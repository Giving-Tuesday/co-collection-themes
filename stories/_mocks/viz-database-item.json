New donor year-to-date retention is 7.1% (down 0.5 percentage points), while repeat donor retention is 25.4% (down 0.1 percentage points). The recapture rate that measures the percent of all lapsed donors (those who did not give in 2024 but had given in the past) is very low at 0.8%, and is down 0.1 percentage points compared to Q1 2024.",
